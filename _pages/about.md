**Welcome to this site**

Hello web traveler, and welcome.

This site is simply a place to keep track of my software projects as well as an archive for solutions to problems be it software or hardware.

The main reason for this is that I keep finding myself searching for solutions to the same problems over and over again.

Being a programming novice/journeyman, this site will hopfully benifit me two-fold, as for the above reason, but also to better understand the code/solutions that im writing.

Thank you for stopping by.
